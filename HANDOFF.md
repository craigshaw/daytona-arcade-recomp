## Current state

**Advanced and Expert original panoramas implemented (4 Oct 2026).**
`--panorama-original` now selects all three Revision A race skies automatically.
Course IDs 0 / 2 / 1 use heights 392 / 344 / 432 at source Y 48. One CPU cache
is replaced on course changes; the GPU buffer grows only as needed, up to
1.69 MiB of sky indices, and uploads on rendered course/game-instance changes.
Sampling and live-source readiness use each course's height. The existing
shared tile pass, palette, split layers and overlays are retained. The proof
image remains Beginner-only. Launcher integration and Deluxe '93 are deferred.

57 replay jobs / 2,667 captures / 42 comparison groups / 1,866 comparisons
pass across Beginner, Advanced and Expert; 795 matching Beginner captures
also agree byte-for-byte with the previous milestone. Each course stays
active throughout all 3,001 race frames from 3000 through 6000. Advanced and
Expert loading and natural-wrap sequences, all four cameras, CPU/GPU skies,
native view, HUD and 2x sampling pass. Their 18,000-frame GPU runs change
Beginner -> selected course -> Beginner, with exactly three uploads and
unchanged centres; 6,000-frame software controls also pass. Eight instances
sharing one GPU renderer pass all 32 synthetic palette stages, including
buffer growth and reuse for smaller skies. No new MAME-parity claim.

Release builds, three targeted CTests and five capture utility tests pass.
Shared SPIR-V/DXIL/MSL regenerated; only Direct3D 12 runtime tested. The local
shader tools were reused; this harness required setting PATH inside Python
after a PowerShell PATH prefix was not inherited by the compiler lookup.
Procedure: `docs/original-panorama.md`. Compact results and before/after
gallery: ignored `traces/course-panoramas/`; all raw captures/logs removed
after hashing. Next: Deluxe '93, live launcher switching and other GPU backends.

**Original panorama milestone implemented (4 Oct 2026), capture tools only.**
Revision A Beginner now uses the original ROM's complete 2048x392 sky via
`--panorama-original`. Cache palette indices/category (1.53 MiB CPU and GPU,
plus CPU validation records), upload once per game instance and sample
inside the existing shared tile shader. Live palette, layer-3 splits,
fillers, overlays and foreground/HUD stay on their original paths. The
normal launcher is unchanged. Native view and unsupported courses/revisions
fall back; stretching applies only when this mode is inactive.

Selector/scroll checks alone failed at loading frame 2580: the game had
selected Beginner before uploading its sky. Readiness now also matches the
visible streamed map columns and referenced character data against the ROM.
No frame-number delays, guest writes or replacement PNG dependency.

25 replay jobs / 1,049 captures / 18 comparison groups pass: 16:9 and 32:9
centres, 100 exact CPU/GPU background pairs, aspect crops, consecutive wrap
and loading transitions, four cameras, full-frame controls, previous-binary
regression, native view, supersampling, HUD and other-course fallback.
All 3,001 frames in the 3000..6000 race interval stay active and ready;
the natural full-phase wrap advances by two texels, with no fallback flicker.
The replay has no active sky-colour fade; `m2panoramacheck` separately proves
four synthetic palette levels over two game instances, all exact CPU/GPU
and original-centre matches, one upload per instance, no guest RAM writes.
Release builds and targeted CTests pass. SPIR-V/DXIL/MSL regenerated from
one HLSL source; only Direct3D 12 runtime tested. Native shader-script calls
now work on Windows; compiler provenance is in `THIRD_PARTY.md`.
Fixed-affinity warmed benchmarks show renderer CPU 0.25/0.26 ms versus
0.23/0.24 ms, with variable GPU wait. Unpinned runs had a whole-system
timing shift; retained both sets, no GPU timestamp or speedup claim.

Procedure and limitations: `docs/original-panorama.md`; ignored gallery and
compact evidence: `traces/original-panorama/`. The new runner discards raw
captures/frame logs after each job. Next: Advanced/Expert original assets,
Deluxe '93, other GPU backends and live launcher integration. This milestone
does not make a new MAME-parity claim.

**Local capture archives pruned (4 Oct 2026).** Work through the panorama
proof and original-art extraction is committed and pushed on
`widescreen-32x9` (`a06e33c`). Removed 10.54 GiB of ignored raw frames,
tile dumps, frame logs, redundant PNGs and an obsolete probe executable.
Kept ROMs, builds, dependencies, cabinet snapshots, compact measurements,
the original-art gallery, three minimal extraction snapshots, representative
scenery images and the panorama comparison/playback viewer. Historical
capture counts below describe completed runs, not files still on disk.
All 400 protected files retain their hashes; the reduced source snapshots
regenerate all 39 artwork PNGs and their source record byte-identically.
Reproduce full validation into a fresh output directory; do not resume or
rebuild reports from these pruned archives. No original-art integration yet.

**Deluxe '93 ROM availability verified (4 Oct 2026).** The supplied
`roms/daytona93.zip` is a split set: all 12 revision-specific files pass
the importer manifest's sizes and recomputed CRC32 values. The other 18
required shared files are present and verified in `roms/daytona.zip`:
30/30 required files are available locally. The existing `daytona.zip`
also already contained byte-identical '93-specific files under `daytona93/`;
earlier assumptions that the '93 ROM was unavailable were incorrect.
The importer reads one archive (and strips member folder prefixes), so the
merged `daytona.zip` contains the complete set for a '93-configured importer;
the new split ZIP alone is incomplete. No new '93 runtime validation yet.
Verification evidence: ignored `traces/rom-verification/daytona93.json`.

**Original backdrop inventory extracted (4 Oct 2026).** Revision A already
has full 2048-pixel panoramas: Beginner 2048x392 (clouds/mountains/grass),
Advanced 2048x344 (clouds), Expert 2048x432 (clouds/ocean), plus a fourth
selector entry 2048x528 (sky/trees/green ground), whose in-game use is
unconfirmed. Four art sets, eight 256-pixel sections each; not 135 assets
despite that many distinct layer-2/3 RGB states in the capture sample.
The game's 512-pixel tilemap is a streaming window onto the larger source.
Earlier reasoning treating it as the complete artwork was incomplete.

All 192 live tile-column comparisons and all three courses' character ROM
upload comparisons pass. Three 9,000-frame course runs and 18,000 attract
frames yield 300 snapshots of all four layers; course ID 3 was not seen.
Source dumping leaves the three frame-3600 screenshots identical. New
read-only capture flag `m2gpushot --dump-tiles DIR`; extraction scripts and
procedure are in `docs/backdrop-inventory.md`. Ignored local gallery:
`traces/backdrop-inventory/artwork/index.html`, with original PNGs, all
32 sections, source/hash records and ZIP. No newly generated artwork and
no original-art renderer integration in this step. Next candidate is reuse
of these complete originals, then palette/fades, split layers and wrap
validation. Replacement artwork is not yet justified. Deluxe '93 deferred.

**Seamless panorama proof implemented (4 Oct 2026), opt-in capture tools only.**
Revision A Beginner uses one original 2048x512 test image across 16:9 and
32:9, repeat-U/clamp-V sampling, the existing background draw and shader.
One 4 MiB CPU image plus one 4 MiB GPU texture, uploaded once per run.
The normal launcher has no panorama option; original view, other courses
and unsupported states retain the existing path. The proof replaces the
complete back-layer composite; final art, palette/fade handling and extra
back-layer overlays remain required before general use.

Full camera phase at 0x5fe11a supplies 2048 texel positions instead of the
tile register's masked 512. Observe writes to 0x501308 and 0x100a004 to
latch the correct frame; direct frame-end reads were rejected because
1,660 of 2,901 samples described a different camera state. No game RAM,
register or emulated timing changes. This replay uses layer-2 vertical
split mode (0x2000), so earlier normal-scroll-only notes are incomplete.

28 capture jobs / 1,022 raw frames: 258 isolated software/GPU pairs and
129 aspect-centre crops match exactly, including a full synthetic cycle.
Real turns, all four cameras and natural full-phase wraps are captured.
Both native controls, 120 default wide baseline frames and 28 inactive
frames are identical. 2x supersampling repeats exact sky pixels. All
3,001 race frames from 3000 through 6000 remain active/valid in each
aspect/renderer run. Panorama/scenery/app-config CTests and Release builds
of the capture tools and normal application pass. Warmed
32:9 renderer CPU time is 0.21 ms/frame versus 0.21..0.22 default;
there is no material overhead in these runs, not a GPU-timestamp result.

Procedure, exact timings and limits: `docs/panorama-proof.md`. Ignored local
viewer/evidence: `traces/panorama-proof/`. The runner resumed after fixing
2x PNG export height (raw pixels/commands unchanged; runner hash migration
is recorded in its manifest). Next: finished course artwork, palette fades
and overlays, then other courses/backends and eventual Deluxe '93 testing.
No new MAME parity or production-wide background claim is made.

**Widescreen scenery and configurable budget implemented (4 Oct 2026).**
Launcher Game > Enhancements now offers 32:9 and Automatic/Custom polygon
budget. Automatic is `ceil(5000 * max(1, W / 496))`, with W at native
height: 5,000 / 6,190 / 6,875 / 9,033 / 13,771 for original / 16:10 /
16:9 / 21:9 / 32:9. It retains the higher existing Further/Furthest
allowance when applicable; Custom (1..1,000,000) overrides both. Zero
means Automatic. Settings persist; resolution/supersampling do not change
the allowance. The supported setting bound is not a renderer capacity
guarantee. State is per board; original view with enhancements off remains
unchanged. Both capture tools expose the same independent budget control.

Widescreen retains the game's selected-cell prefix and order, then appends
missing in-range cells by nearest ring. r13's course/grid exclusion mask
remains; r9's directional mask no longer removes candidate cells for the
widened view. The geometrizer clips the conservative set for the active
camera. Default keeps the 5x5 radius; shorter choices retain their radius;
Further/Furthest retain their existing full-neighbourhood selection.
Revision A cost observers at 0x17c04/0x17d50 and budget checks at
0x17b00/0x17d28 measure object-list metadata before clipping, not visible
polygons. Rejections are strict unsigned consumed > allowance checks
between lists; overshoot within a list is possible. No register or RAM
writes in observers. Regenerate from the updated hooks before building.

Validation: Revision A, Windows / Direct3D 12 and software, three verified
courses, all four race cameras, original through 32:9. The 48-case matrix
replayed 432,000 frames and captured 1,440 images; 660 sampled comparisons
against a 50,000-budget control were identical (including four matching
Beginner references reused from an earlier run). Some 16:10/16:9 lists
were rejected; all 1,438 consecutive frame pairs around those events,
including two-frame margins, were identical to 50,000. No budget rejections
at 21:9/32:9. Maximum wide-view measured cost was 7,517. This supports the
agreed defaults for these replays, not every possible route or frame.

The reproduced building is restored at both Automatic and explicit 5,000;
all 41 frames match between them. All 90 native-view captures over three
9,000-frame replays are byte-identical to the preserved pre-change
executable. A 2x 32:9 capture retains budget 13,771 and cost 4,974.
Release builds, two new CTest tests, five capture-tool tests and invalid
CLI argument checks pass. Tests cover selection bounds/masks/order,
per-board state, budget transitions and config persistence. Raw throughput
measurements are recorded separately from capture I/O; single sequential
runs are not evidence that 32:9 is faster than original.

Failed approach retained: the old generic Advanced/Expert input scripts
entered Beginner with this Revision A snapshot. Selection uses an absolute
wheel position: hold through confirmation; Expert also needs settling
before acceleration. New `widescreen_advanced.txt` and
`widescreen_expert.txt` plus course-ID assertions resolve this. Do not use
the abandoned `traces/widescreen-implementation/matrix` as three-course
evidence; the verified run is `verified-matrix`. Generic inputs remain
unchanged for their existing users.

Results, exact commands, hashes and screenshots are under ignored
`traces/widescreen-implementation/`; procedure and coverage are in
`docs/widescreen-validation.md`. Deluxe '93 smoke is explicitly deferred
until the user has its ROM; the new cost observers are mapped only for
Revision A. No claim of new MAME parity. Next work: the later Deluxe '93 check,
then sky/background presentation, HUD and any separately justified road
window changes; other GPU backends and live launcher switching also need
manual coverage.

### Earlier widescreen investigation

**32:9 scenery experiment: omitted cells, not budget, explain the reproduced building.**
`scripts/scenery_experiment.py` replays six independent conditions with
frozen inputs/settings and captures all 41 frames from 3580 to 3620.
Original selection at budgets 5,000, 10,000 and 50,000 is byte-identical
throughout. Further selection at 5,000 is byte-identical to Further at
10,000 throughout and restores the missing section. At frame 3600 the
selected cell count changes from 10 to 25 and 20,483 RGB pixels change.
Budget 1 changes 464,076 pixels at that frame, verifying the override
works. A separate ordering control retains original membership but changes
its order in all 41 frames: the building stays absent, frame 3600 is
identical to original and other frames differ by at most two pixels.
Do not re-propose raising budget alone as the fix for this particular defect.

At that stage, headless diagnostic flags were `--draw-budget`, `--draw-order-only`,
`--scenery-log`; zero/false defaults preserve ordinary behaviour. The log
records RAM budget and selected cells, not polygon consumption. Builds
pass; default captures match the previous 32:9 baseline in all 41 frames,
and native frame 3600 remains byte-identical. Local results/commands/hashes:
`traces/widescreen-32x9/selection-budget/`; procedure and scope limits in
`docs/widescreen-validation.md`. There was no launcher change or production
scenery fix at that stage; the implementation above follows this experiment.
Other scenes may still need more budget; this experiment
does not establish their requirements.

**32:9 validation tooling and first reproduced scenery defect.**
`scripts/widescreen_compare.py` wraps m2run/m2gpushot with frozen cabinet
settings and input scripts, executable/ROM/input hashes, checked frame
counts and dimensions, PNGs, pixel comparisons and an HTML viewer. Both
tools gained `--dump-from FRAME` for consecutive-frame investigations.
At that stage, launcher and game rendering were unchanged. Procedure and findings:
`docs/widescreen-validation.md`; local game-derived output is ignored at
`traces/widescreen-32x9/`.

Revision A, Windows / Direct3D 12: original, 16:9, 21:9 and 32:9 on both
renderers; 9,000 attract frames and the 20,000-frame race_to_end input.
768 sparse captures, plus 164 captures of frames 3580..3620 at original
and 32:9. The replay reaches racing, timeout and results, then returns to
selection with remaining credits. Frame 3600 at 32:9 has a missing
building section left of the TRACK HAWKS sign on both renderers. Further
and Furthest restore it and produce identical dumps at that frame;
Further changes 20,483 pixels at x=0..285, y=61..201, zero in the central
native view. This initially implicated scenery selection/budget because
Further changes both. The follow-up experiment above separates the two
and identifies omitted cells as the cause of this reproduced defect.

The plain-sky/background-art boundary remains conspicuous (attract 7200).
Pixel counts alone are not defect verdicts: odd margins flip the existing
absolute-coordinate checker transparency phase; clipping/interpolation
also changes pixels. GPU/software differences exist at original width
too (attract 8100). Five synthetic capture-tool checks pass; actual dumps
validate dimensions, counts and resume, and the viewer controls were
checked in the browser. Frame 3600 is byte-identical between sparse and
consecutive runs in all four shared renderer/ratio combinations.
No claim of complete 32:9 support or gameplay
performance benchmarking; HUD/background options, other sets/backends,
all playable courses and live ratio switching remain outside this pass.

**Vita build: the ROM set.** The 1994 set's M2_ROMSET broke the Vita compile
check (its CMake builds the runtime itself, without the define);
platform/vita/CMakeLists.txt defines M2_ROMSET="daytona93", and
rom_import.h falls back to daytona93 when a build does not say. Checked on
the link-play branch's CI: Vita compile check passes (with link play's
comm_board added to the Vita runtime there).

**Link play (branch link-play).** Revision A's communication board
(837-10537), from MAME's m2comm simulation: src/runtime/comm_board.{h,cpp}
(the protocol: shared RAM set-up at cn_w, the master's 0xff/0xfe numbering
tokens round the ring, every frame each cabinet's 0xe00-byte block from
shared 0x2000 to the next, landing at 0x21c0, and the master's 0xfc vsync;
frame sync optional, off by default as in MAME). M2Board::set_link attaches
it to a LinkTransport; with none (the default, and daytona93) the comm
registers stay plain, so nothing changes. src/app/link_socket.cpp: TCP, this
cabinet listens, connects to the next (retried until it answers), non-
blocking reads, whole-frame sends with a 2 s limit, POSIX or Winsock. App:
launcher Game tab "Link play" (on/off, port, next host:port, frame sync,
status line); daytona --profile NAME for a second cabinet on one computer;
m2run --link-listen/--link-next/--link-sync and --save-nvram. Master and
slave are the game's own settings (test mode > GAME SYSTEM: LINK ID, CAR
NUMBER; factory: MASTER, car 1, twin). Checked: tests/test_comm_board.cpp
(two boards in memory: numbering, data both ways, frames in pieces, loss);
two headless m2run cabinets on localhost (master: factory EEPROM; slave: one
set to LINK ID SLAVE, CAR NUMBER 2 through test mode by script): the
linked attract (通信システム 2人まで対戦できます), both through the linked
course and transmission select, a race with POSITION /2 on both, red car
(car 1) and blue car (car 2); "cabinet 1 of 2" / "2 of 2"; the link lost
when the other cabinet quits. Not checked: two computers, Wi-Fi, frame
sync, more than three cabinets.
First two-computer try (Mac 192.168.1.52 slave, port 15112, next
192.168.1.2:15113; the other the master): NETWORK CHECKING, because the
other computer was not listening on 15113 (connection refused: its port was
still the default 15112). The launcher's waiting status now says which half
of the ring is missing (next cabinet reached or not; a cabinet connected to
this port or not), and the help says every computer can use the same port.
Then linked on two computers once the cabinets' settings matched (the game
cancels the link, "CANCELLED", when they differ: one was DELUXE/USA, the
other TWIN/JPN). Native audio then stopped the game: linked play's music
turns on the MultiPCM LFO (MIDI controller 0x01, value 1, channels 0 and 5;
found with the new m2run --native-audio-check on a headless linked pair,
frames ~1,510), which the native mixer does not have, and the app treated
any unsupported effect as a fault. Now it plays without the vibrato and
says so once in the log; invalid data and callback failures still stop it.
Open: the LFO in the native mixer (the driver's controller 0x01 handler to
MultiPCM registers 6/7, MAME's multipcm LFO).
Tested by the user: three computers linked (Windows, macOS and Linux), all
played well.

**The seed_scan seeds checked against MAME (daytona93).** A local MAME
build (scripts/build_mame.sh) and scripts/m2_check.sh on every scenario: the
11 in scripts/inputs and two new ones, attract_long (9,000 frames of
attract) and race_to_end (race_basic played on to 20,000 frames: out of
time, game over and the screens after). All match MAME in every check:
native i960 code (every device event and interrupt), the native
geometrizer, the CPU 3D layer, the composed screen, the recompiled TGP and
the sound 68000. race_to_end alone: 2.16 billion i960 instructions, 19,997
frames, 20.2 million polygons, 597 million TGP and 261 million 68000
instructions identical. Coverage (MAME's indirect-branch log against the
seed list): the 11 old scenarios reach all 334 harvest seeds and none of the
248 seed_scan seeds (they are the harvest's own scenarios); attract_long and
race_to_end reach 81 of them (10 of 19 game modes, 13 of 29 task states, 3 of
85 jump-table entries, 5 of 16 lda tables, 48 of 92 ROM-record handlers, 2 of
7 data-ROM pointers), now checked. The other 167 need states no scenario
reaches yet (other endings, name entry, link play). Found on the way:
- An Apple silicon MAME differed from ours in the geometrizer's last bit
  (attract frame 173): clang fuses a*b+c into FMA on arm64 by default;
  build_mame.sh now builds it with -ffp-contract=off, like our code.
- build_mame.sh picks a Python whose XML parser loads (Homebrew's Python
  3.14 here had a pyexpat built against a newer libexpat: "No parsers
  found"); setup.sh --build-mame on macOS installs sdl3 and pkgconf (MAME's
  macOS front end is SDL 3, found through pkg-config), not sdl2.
- The first m2_check run of race_to_end stopped at 6,897 frames (cause not
  found: MAME's output goes to /dev/null there); run again by hand, MAME
  recorded all 19,997 frames and every check matched.

**Setup builds the 1994 set too.** scripts/setup.py builds every set it
finds in roms/: daytona93 into build/ (as before), daytona (Revision A) into
build-daytona/ (configured as the main build, with -DM2_ROMSET), and prints
how to start each. The rejection and no-ROM messages name both sets.
getting-started.md and the README describe both, including Revision A's
first run (a single cabinet set in test mode). Checked: setup.py from a
configured tree with both sets in roms/: both games built, tests pass.

**Widescreen: scene or 2D screen, by window and coverage.** The margins'
fill (stretched or sky behind a 3D scene, each row's edge colours on a 2D
screen) was chosen by "the 3D covers half the screen". Attract and race
camera shots that look at a lot of sky cover 36-49% (measured: daytona93
attract frames 720-780, 6720-6860, 7020-7140, 8320-8460; Revision A the
same kind), so those frames smeared their sky's edge colours sideways and
then snapped to stretched when the camera moved. Video::scene(): one window
and at least 15% coverage. Measured over attract and race_basic on both
sets: daytona93's car and circuit select draw their 3D in 2-3 windows,
Revision A's select screens have no 3D, titles none; every one-window frame
with 15-49% is a scene. Checked: daytona93 attract frame 760 now stretched,
circuit select still edge colours (16:10, stretch on).

**Wheels, pedals and force feedback.** Controls gained a third binding
column, Wheel / joystick: every SDL joystick is opened (app::Devices), and
an action binds to an axis, button or hat direction of a device by GUID, so a
wheel, pedals and a shifter can be separate devices. An axis is calibrated
when bound: the capture records where it rested and how far it was moved
before being let go (pedals resting at either end or short of full range; a
900-degree wheel's chosen lock). Saved as `<action>.joy=` lines, with
`joy_deadzone`. Force feedback: the game writes the drive board's command to
I/O board dual-port RAM byte 0x11 (found by logging its writes: 44 in a
race, every type), which IoBoard queues; rt::DriveBoard decodes them (the
command set of Sega's later drive boards, as Supermodel documents it:
0x1- centring, 0x2- friction, 0x3- vibration, 0x5-/0x6- pull right/left, 0xc-
reset; 0x0-/0x4- sequences and 0x7- not modelled) and app::ForceFeedback
plays them on the steering device: SDL haptics (spring, friction, sine,
constant force on the steering axis; only changed levels sent) or rumble.
Launcher: Force feedback strength (70% default, Off) and Invert force; m2run
prints the commands by type. Checked: tests/test_app_controls.cpp with SDL
virtual joysticks (a wheel and pedals resting at +32767; config round trip;
ADC values; a wheel paddle; unplugging; drive command decoding; rumble and
its scaling and stop). Not checked: a real wheel or force feedback (none here; user
testing): the launcher marks the wheel column, its dead zone and force
feedback Experimental; the direction of the pull may need Invert force.

**The 1994 set (daytona, Revision A) builds and runs, for comparison.**
CMake `M2_ROMSET` (daytona93, the default, or daytona), one set per build
directory: `scripts/recompile.py --set daytona --build-dir build-daytona`
with the set at roms/daytona.7z. The importer has both sets' MAME tables
(Revision A: other program, sound program, two main data ROMs mirrored from
0x800000, two polygon and two texture ROMs; the TGP program is the same
2,024 words, at main_data 0x800020). Saves are per set (pref folder
daytona-recomp/<set>). Seeds: seeds/daytona.txt, the daytona93 seeds carried
over by code (new scripts/seed_map.py: 469 of 582, 175 of them by
alignment where the revision inserted code), then seed_scan.py --set
daytona (239 more; 38,001 instructions reachable). Revision A does some
float maths on the i960's FPU instead of the TGP: m2recomp gained addr, subr
and modi (MAME's semantics; register forms only; daytona93's generated code
unchanged). Hooks: seeds/daytona_hooks.txt, draw distance at 0x17508
(daytona93's draw-list routine moved by 0x490: the same masked instructions,
RAM and boot-time budget); checked: -2 and +2 change the frames as on
daytona93. Its default settings are a linked twin cabinet, which waits on the
link at the settings screen: set a single cabinet in test mode (F2) once;
m2run and m2gpushot `--nvram DIR` load the app's saved EEPROM and backup RAM
(tools/common/nvram.h). Checked with that: 12,000 attract frames, and every
input script (races on all three courses, steering, test mode screens)
runs with no missing code; race_basic plays through circuit select,
transmission select, the rolling start and the race, with drive board
commands. Native audio works on Revision A too: its sound program has the
native sequencer's tables from 0x505a on 0x48 bytes later, their pointers
with them (sequence banks and engine sound tables unmoved); the sequencer
detects the layout by those tables' first pointers. scripts/
test_native_sound_oracle.sh takes the set from the ROM folder's name and
M2_NVRAM=DIR: Revision A race, 6,000 frames: 4,892 of 4,893 notes the same
as the reference audio (the extra one at the run's last instant), the same
two pitch differences as daytona93, RMS ratio 1.02, no invalid data.
Why: the arcade's wheels sit inside the wheel arches with a gap; ours (and
MAME's) poke out over the wings. The car code and data are the same in both
revisions (wheel table at 0x234af4 / 0x230d54: ±0.525, 0.32, 1.4125/-1.4;
body and wheel models on shared polygon ROMs), and Revision A here frames
the arcade footage's bridge shot (frames 8680-8780) almost exactly and still
shows the tyres over the wings: not a revision difference. In attract the
car is moved by the course-following routine (0xca40), so body roll is 0
and pitch small; the full physics (0xf31c) does not run. Open: what on the
board differs (the geometrizer port, the TGP).

**Super sampling (hardware renderer).** Launcher > Game > Super sampling:
Off, 2x, 3x, 4x (`supersampling=` in launcher.ini; m2gpushot
`--scale N`). GpuRenderer::render draws into a target `scale` times the
frame: vertices stay in original pixels (the viewport scales them), clip
rectangles and the depth buffer scale, the tile shaders map target pixels
back to original ones (tiledata[2]; tile pixels repeated), and textures
take a finer mip level, log2(scale) levels (texlod + 128 log2(scale); the
rasterizer picks levels from z, not screen size). The checker pattern is
per target pixel. main draws it into its own texture with mip levels and
shows the level nearest the window's size, so a frame bigger than the
window is averaged down (supersampling). 1x: byte-identical to before (104
race frames, 16:9). race_basic 16:9 headless (Metal): 455 / 389 / 295 /
265 frames/s at 1x / 2x / 3x / 4x. Checked: a 3x race frame (no cracks,
HUD in place) and the app at 3x (700 frames).

**Tilemaps, step 2: drawn on the GPU (hardware renderer).** m2.hlsl
ps_tiles_back / ps_tiles_front compose the System 24 layers per pixel with
Video::draw's rules (window masks, per-line scroll, the split modes, the
back pass's opaque 3 and 2), then the widescreen margins as fill_margins
(edge colours, the sky's colour, or stretched). Inputs: the decoded pixmaps
(a u16 per pixel, pen and category; uploaded by the span of tile rows
changed since the last upload, by the tile generations; never with
SDL's cycle flag, which would drop the rows not sent), and a per-frame
snapshot Video takes at screen_update of tile RAM 0x4000-0x6fff and the
4,096 pens. Video's external-3D `cpu_layers` is now `desktop`: the CPU only
estimates the 3D coverage (margin fill) and, with the HUD at the edges in a
race, still draws the front layers and moves the HUD blobs (uploaded as a
texture then). Checked against the previous build (CPU-drawn layers):
byte-identical frames, 0 pixels differ, over race_basic at 4:3, 16:9,
16:9 stretched and 21:9 with the HUD at the edges, the advanced and expert
courses, test mode and test drive (622 frames; the races use split modes
and per-line scroll). race_basic 4:3: 400 -> 526 frames/s; game 1.82 ->
1.03 ms, renderer CPU 0.53 -> 0.33 ms, GPU 0.16 -> 0.54 ms. Tested by the
user on macOS (Metal), Windows and Linux.

**Tilemaps, step 1: decode only changed tiles (both renderers).** Measured
first (m2gpushot --bench now reads Video's own timers): of the hardware
frame's 2.2 ms game time, the CPU tilemaps took 1.27 ms: decoding the four
512x512 layers 0.55 ms (all 16,384 tiles, every frame), drawing them with the
scroll/split/mask rules 0.63 ms, composing 0.09 ms. Video::decode_layers
(desktop; the Vita path keeps its own cache) re-decodes only tiles whose
value or character changed, comparing character RAM (256-byte pages, then
32-byte characters) only on frames the game wrote it. Same pixmaps: race,
time attack, test mode and attract screen hashes unchanged. Decoding 0.55 ->
0.02 ms; hardware 343 -> 409 frames/s, software race 189 -> 204. Next: the
layers drawn on the GPU (0.65 ms drawing + 0.09 composing).

**Vulkan application name (MangoHud showed "SDL").** SDL's Vulkan backend
hard-codes VkApplicationInfo: no application name, engine "SDLGPU", which
overlays such as MangoHud show instead of the API; SDL has no property to
change it. `patches/sdl3/0001-vulkan-application-name.patch` (applied by
setup.py's new apply_patches, shared with MAME's patches; already-applied
patches are skipped; fetch forces the checkout if a patched file would block
a new pin) reports SDL_SetAppMetadata's name ("Daytona USA", set by main)
and no engine name. Checked: setup re-applies it after a revert and skips it
when present; macOS builds and runs. The MangoHud result itself is untested
here (no MangoHud on macOS).

**Windows: the game's messages.** daytona is a WIN32 (GUI) program, so on
Windows its output went nowhere and a command window returned at once; a
tester could not see which renderer ran. It now attaches to the parent
console when there is one, else writes daytona.log in the pref folder, and
prints `daytona: renderer hardware (GPU)` / `software (CPU)` whenever the
active renderer changes. Checked on macOS (both lines); the Windows branch is
compiled by CI only.

**Hardware renderer speed (`m2gpushot --bench`).** race_basic, 6,000 frames,
headless on this Mac (Metal): software 189 frames/s (5.3 ms a frame) at 4:3
and 188 at 16:9; hardware 324 (3.1 ms) and 347. Hardware frame at 4:3: game
2.20 ms (logic, geometrizer, CPU tilemap layers), renderer on the CPU 0.72 ms
(vertices, uploads, a 4 MB texture RAM compare, the colour table), waiting
for the GPU 0.17 ms. From the draw-mode figures (every third frame drawn:
442 frames/s), logic is about 0.75 ms, the CPU tilemap layers about 1.45 ms
and the CPU 3D rasterizer about 3 ms a frame. Next costs, in order: tilemaps
on the GPU; texture RAM tracked by writes instead of compared.
Done: M2Board::tex_write counts writes (VideoMem::tex_generation) and the
renderer uploads texture RAM only when the count moves; the 4 MB compare and
shadow copy are gone. Renderer CPU 0.72 -> 0.54 ms, 324 -> 346 frames/s at
4:3; GPU frames byte-identical to before (8 of 8 sampled).

**Hardware renderer, widescreen and a mip-level fix.** Hardware mode keeps
widescreen: Video's external-3D mode with CPU layers no longer drops the
margin (only the Vita path does); both layers are width() wide, the
backdrop's margins filled as in software mode with the 3D coverage taken
from Raster::coverage_estimate (the polygons on an 8x8-pixel grid; no CPU 3D
layer exists here) and the front layer's HUD moved to the edges; the GPU
projects with the margin, widens full-width windows into it, and moves the
condition panel's quads by Video::gpu_hud_shift (same box and z as the
software path). Fix found while comparing: the rasterizer's max mip level is
30 - countl_zero(min(w, h)) = log2(min) - 1; stage 2 used log2(min), so a
fading circuit-select map (texlod -321, mml 1132) took level 7 not 6 and
came out coloured instead of grey. Measured after (race_basic, Metal,
m2gpushot vs m2run, every 650 frames to 5200): 89.7-100% identical,
94.4-100% within 8 levels; the rest are rounding on high-contrast textures
(road lines, rock), where a one-step texel coordinate difference flips the
blend. 16:9 with HUD at the edges: race frames 94.8-98.3% identical.

**Hardware renderer, stage 2 (textures).** ps_poly is a port of the
rasterizer's draw_tex_span and fetch_bilinear_texel in integer arithmetic:
the 4-bit sheets with their 2048x1024-as-1024x2048 mapping, bilinear 8-bit
blending (LERP), wrap/mirror/edge rules, mip levels by fast_log2 (the same
128-entry table) and texlod, the microtexture, the translucency flag and
test, the luma RAM and the colour translation. Data: three read-only storage
buffers (texture RAM, both sheets, uploaded only when it changes; luma RAM;
colour translation with the rasterizer's gamma applied on the CPU); per
polygon texture state as flat integers decoded as render_one does; 1/z, u/z,
v/z interpolated noperspective. Measured (race_basic, Metal, m2gpushot vs
m2run): frame 1500 99.9% of pixels identical; race frames 3000 and 4500
95.5% and 95.1% identical, 98.4% and 98.8% within 8 levels. The differences
are scattered over textured surfaces (far road, rock face), not edges:
float differences flipping mip-level and texel thresholds. The rasterizer
accumulates 1/z, u/z, v/z per pixel along each span; the GPU evaluates each
pixel's directly, and Metal compiles with fast math. Exactness is stage 4.
build_shaders.py pulls the x86-64 Ubuntu image explicitly (a cached arm64
one failed with "exec format error").

**Hardware renderer, stage 1 (geometry).** Launcher > Game > Renderer:
Software (exact; default) or Hardware (Experimental). `src/app/gpu/`:
`m2.hlsl` (one source) -> `scripts/build_shaders.py` (DXC v1.9.2609 to
SPIR-V and DXIL, SPIRV-Cross to MSL; Docker when the tools are not
installed) -> `shaders_gen.h` (committed; builds need no shader tools).
GpuRenderer draws the 3D in the rasterizer's order (window, then z, newest
first), projected as model2_3d_project, each polygon a fan from vertex 0,
clipped to its window by scissor; a depth buffer with depth = draw order
and LESS reproduces "first polygon to fill a pixel wins" (the rasterizer's
fill buffer). Colour: the solid renderer's palette/luma/gamma; textures are
stage 2 (the Vita GPU path is a reference only: a tester saw small road
geometry/orientation errors there). Video's external-3D mode gained
`cpu_layers` (the CPU still draws the tilemap layers for it; the Vita path
does not). No widescreen in hardware mode yet. `m2gpushot` renders frames
offscreen through it for comparison with m2run's (tools/common/
input_script.h shared). Checked on Metal: the game runs (710 frames in
15 s), and a race frame's geometry, HUD and backdrop line up with the
software renderer's. Not yet run on Vulkan or Direct3D 12.

**Draw mode (frame skip).** Measured first: Daytona runs the board in 60 Hz
mode and the geometrizer starts a new frame every vblank (3,000 of 3,000
race frames drew a new 3D picture), i.e. double buffered. Launcher > Game >
Draw mode: Double buffered (every frame, the default), Single buffered
(every 2nd), Every third frame (every 3rd); `m2run --frame-skip 0|1|2`.
M2Board::vblank_end skips screen_update on the frames between (3D raster,
tilemaps, composition), keeping the last picture; the geometrizer still
parses every frame (the game reads its polygon count). Measured race_basic:
identical i960 (196,665,345), TGP (223,429,779) instruction, interrupt
(12,050) and sound byte (3,636) counts in all three; 190, 332, 442 frames/s
headless on this Mac. Default hash unchanged.

**Skip launcher.** Launcher > Game > "Skip launcher" (saved): start-up goes
straight into the game, as `--autostart` does, when the ROM set checks out;
otherwise the launcher shows with the reason. Esc still opens it. Checked:
with it set, `daytona` started the game at once (377 frames in 8 s).

**"Stretch tile background" stretches, it does not extend.** In a race, with
the option on, the backdrop as drawn for the 496 columns is scaled across
the whole width (linear blend per row); the tester wanted no repeat at all.
Video::draw_ext (drawing the tiles past the screen edge) is removed. Earlier:

**Widescreen sky: plain by default, "Stretch tile background" to extend.**
A tester still saw a seam in the margins with the tile backdrop drawn out.
Measured: the race sky is tilemap layer 2, one layer in normal scroll mode
(not a split pair: the split-mode alternation added to draw_ext changed 0
pixels there), and its hscroll sweeps the whole 0..511 range over a lap
(152 values), so the original 4:3 screen passes the picture's join too;
only ~79% of rows match across it. So the margins default to the sky's
plain colour behind 3D, and launcher > Enhancements > "Stretch tile
background (Experimental)" (`m2run --stretch-backdrop`) draws the tiles out.
2D screens keep each row's edge colours either way. Split pairs in draw_ext
now alternate A/B every 512 columns (a 1024-pixel panorama), as the
hardware's layout implies; not exercised by Daytona's race sky.

**Launcher labels.** Options that need it say so: "Graphics API (Restart
Required)"; "Native audio (Experimental, Reset Required)" (it applies when a
game starts or is reset, not on an app restart); "HUD at the screen edges
(Experimental)". Everything else applies straight away.

**Draw distance (enhancement, off by default).** Launcher slider (Shortest,
Shorter, Default, Further, Furthest = -2..+2), `m2run --draw-distance N`.
Found by tracing, not by guessing: the geometrizer's master z clip is unused
(0xff); object commands in the display list are written by the TGP, which
reads model lists from its own ROM (only 8 of ~3,000 i960 FIFO words per
frame match model addresses). The i960 picks what to draw:
- Scenery by course cell: a 16x16 grid (cell = x + 16 y; offsets table
  0x17136 = dx + 16 dy). 0x16f74..0x17070 takes the 5x5 around the car's cell
  (r8) in nearest-first order (0x17104; 0x1711d on two courses), kept where
  two visibility masks allow (r13 from 0x171f8, r9 from 0x1727c), into the
  draw list (count 0x5016c0, cells 0x5016c1.., 63 bytes before 0x501700) and
  a near list of the 10 nearest (0x501600) plus bitmaps 0x501500/20/40.
  Measured over a race: 8-13 cells listed, always reaching radius 2.
- 0x17828 draws every object of each listed cell (table 0x501420) until a
  per-frame polygon budget runs out: 0x5010e8 accumulates each object's cost,
  0x5010f4 is the limit (5000, set once at 0x1210), checked at 0x17a78 and
  0x1786c. Extra cells appended to the list drew nothing until the budget
  was raised: it, not distance, is what stopped them.
- The road: a 14-section window (0x13f5c: 5 back via +0x8c, 14 forward via
  +0x88, list at +0x5c of its struct; ordered pair checks via table 0x13ec4
  and TGP maths at 0x14180). Also game logic (car/section interaction);
  not changed.
Mechanism: `m2recomp --hooks FILE` ("ADDRESS name": the generated code calls
rt::hook_<name>(c) before that instruction), `seeds/daytona93_hooks.txt`,
`src/runtime/enhance.{h,cpp}`. hook_draw_list at 0x17078: -1 keeps the
game's list within one cell, -2 the car's cell only; +1 lists all 5x5, +2
all 7x7 (inside the grid), and raises the budget to 10000 / 15000 (restored
to 5000 back at default). Only the draw list and the budget change; the near
list and bitmaps the game logic reads do not. Measured (race_basic, m2run on
this Mac): -2 242 frames/s, -1 198, default 193, +1 190, +2 185; default's
screen hash unchanged (ad67233983ea8808). +2 adds visible scenery (frame
2600: 1,560 pixels, a tree line behind the billboard); most frames differ
by tens of pixels, because the road, not the scenery, is the horizon.

**Setup's "ROM set rejected" was shown for any recompile failure.** A
Windows tester got it with a zip that imports on macOS and Linux. The
reader is portable C++ (binary I/O, fixed-width fields, its own inflate
and CRC), so the likelier cause is a later step failing on Windows (the
game's generated code has never been compiled there) under the wrong
message. `recompile.py` now exits 3 only when `m2import` rejects the set;
any other failure gets "ROM accepted, the build failed, see the errors
above". The tester's next run confirmed it: the ROM was accepted and the
generated code compiled (`m2run`, `m2native` built); the final build step
still failed. Likely cause, not yet confirmed on Windows: `daytona` is a
WIN32 (GUI) executable and `main.cpp` did not include `SDL3/SDL_main.h`,
so nothing provided `WinMain`. Now included (no effect on macOS/Linux).
The tester's next output showed the real failure: MSVC building SDL itself,
`yuv_rgb_internal.h` C2099 "initializer is not a constant". Our directory-
wide `/fp:strict` reached SDL, and under it MSVC will not fold C float
constants in static initializers. SDL now gets an empty COMPILE_OPTIONS
(ours keep /fp:strict). CI never built SDL (it was only added with
generated game code); SDL, ImGui and the app objects (`daytona_app`) now
build whenever extern/sdl3 exists, so CI compiles them on every OS; only
linking `daytona` still needs a ROM set. CI then compiled SDL, ImGui and
`daytona_app` under MSVC and clang-cl (including the yuv_rgb file that
failed). The tester's PC had built with MSVC: setup.ps1's Visual Studio
Installer `modify` ran unelevated and, it seems, failed quietly. setup.ps1
now runs it elevated, checks the Clang toolset with vswhere afterwards,
stops with instructions if it is missing, and sets M2_COMPILER=clang
(`--msvc` for MSVC). Untested on a real PC; CI only checks it parses
(GitHub's Windows runners have no winget). README's Setup and
docs/getting-started.md now cover Clang on Windows and `--msvc`, updating,
a clean rebuild, the "build failed" message, and the widescreen options.

**Widescreen (enhancement, off by default).** Launcher > Enhancements >
Widescreen: Original (4:3), 16:10 (614x384), 16:9 (682x384), 21:9
(896x384); `m2run --aspect 16:9` for headless dumps. More of the scene at
the sides, same focal length, nothing stretched: `Geo::set_wide_margin`
opens a full-width viewport's left/right clip planes by the margin,
`Raster` draws into a wider layer (stride >= 496 + 2 x margin) with the
clip widened for full-width viewports, `Video` composes at `width()` with
the tilemaps centred and each back-layer row carried into the margins (the
sky's colour, not the backdrop pen). With it off every path is the old one:
all 11 scenarios give their previous screen hashes. With 16:9 all 11 run to
the end. Sampled 21:9 race frames show no obvious edge pop-in yet; not
checked frame by frame.
"HUD at the screen edges" (with widescreen; `m2run --hud-edges`): two
groups in 496-wide coordinates move out by the margin: lap and lap times
(x < 125, y < 130) left; position, condition panel and course map
(x >= 352, y < 300) right. Decided per item: the front layers' pixels are
grouped into blobs (pixels within 4 of each other join) and a blob moves
only if it lies wholly inside a group, so a banner crossing a group stays
whole and centred. The first version decided per area (a band at the cut
had to be empty): during the rolling start the banner's letters passed the
cut, the decision flipped frame to frame and the HUD jumped back and forth.
Measured after, frames 2585-3200 every 5th: the course map is at the edge
in all but the first (HUD not yet drawn). "40TH/40" reaches x 367. The
condition panel's box and car are polygons in the main 3D window at sort z
0x600 (scenery there is above 18000); overlay polygons (z <= 0x0fff) inside
a group move with it, but only while the race HUD is on screen: a tester
saw the car's door come off in an attract close-up, because the car's own
near polygons (and the ranking screen's 2D markers) sat in the HUD's
right-hand area and were moved. Now nothing moves unless the frame has the
condition panel's box (one checker-shaded overlay polygon, texheader
0x8000, sort z <= 0x0fff, ~77x82 at x 385..462, y 67..149;
Raster::race_hud_visible). Measured after: 240 attract frames at 16:9
identical with the option on and off; the race HUD still moves, and the
map stays at the edge through the rolling start. A tester still saw 3D
moved in play: the rule was any polygon at sort z <= 0x0fff inside the right
group. Now only the condition panel's own quads move: polygons at exactly
the box's z inside the box's outline (Raster::find_race_hud records both).
Measured: race at 16:10, option on vs off, 0 of 120 frames differ outside
the HUD areas.
Side margins: in a 3D scene (the 3D layer covers >= 50% of the screen;
measured races 69-100%, select screens ~23%) the back layers are drawn
margin to margin by Video::draw_ext, draw()'s rules pixel by pixel for any
screen column: scroll, per-line scroll, the split modes that put layers
L and L^1 side by side, priority, window masks. Checked: its visible columns
equal draw()'s on every frame of a race (M2_CHECK_DRAW_EXT=1 prints any
difference; none). Earlier tries, all wrong in play: one plain sky colour;
each row's edge carried out (smeared the clouds); copying columns mod 512
(a tester saw the backdrop duplicated with a seam: a column off the screen
can belong to the other layer of a split pair); a "joins up across the
wrap" test to tell sky from menus (failed on the race sky, median 79% of
rows). On 2D screens (car, circuit select) each row carries its own edge
colours: their art covers only the 496 columns, and drawing further shows
leftover tiles as stripes. Before that the margins were the sky's plain colour (the back
layers' top-left pixel); carrying each row's edge out smeared the sky
picture's clouds and mountains. Off: all scenario hashes unchanged; 21:9
with it on: all scenarios run to the end. rules.md now lets enhancements change game logic.
Measured for draw distance: Daytona leaves the master z clip at 0xff
(0 polygons culled by distance over a 6,000-frame race); backface 4.2M,
behind the camera 1.1M, off-screen 1.4M. The limit is in the game's code.

**Windows: Clang by default; MSVC fixed.** MSVC failed on SoftFloat: the
CMake used SoftFloat's `build/Linux-x86_64-GCC/platform.h` everywhere, whose
`opts-GCC.h` needs `__int128`, `__builtin_clz` and GNU inline (C4235, C4013).
MSVC and clang-cl now get `cmake/softfloat-portable/platform.h` (no
`INLINE_LEVEL`, no builtins, no 128-bit type) and `__declspec(thread)` /
`thread_local` for its globals; `-DM2_SOFTFLOAT_PORTABLE=ON` forces that
header anywhere. Measured here with it forced: `test_fp` 0 mismatches,
race_basic, time_attack and course_expert screen hashes identical to the
GCC-header build. `setup.ps1` installs (or adds to an existing Visual
Studio) the Clang tools; `setup.py` builds with the ClangCL toolset when
present, MSVC otherwise (`M2_COMPILER=clang|msvc` forces one), and
reconfigures a build directory set up for the other.
`.github/workflows/build.yml` builds and tests both, without a ROM set,
alongside macOS and Linux (GCC, Clang).
Not yet run on a Windows PC here; a tester reports Clang + Ninja builds.
First CI run: SoftFloat compiled under both; both then stopped on
`tests/test_vita_gpu_memory.cpp`, `alignas(262144)` (C2345; clang-cl: 8192
bytes at most on Windows). That buffer is now aligned at run time, and the
nine Vita host tests are opt-in (`-DM2_VITA_TESTS=ON`, 21 tests) instead of
part of every desktop build (12 tests).

**PS Vita frontend merged (PR #3, `c3007c6`).** Desktop unchanged by it,
measured: all 11 scripted scenarios and 3,000 frames of attract give the
same instruction counts and screen hashes as `398eb4b`; 21/21 tests pass.
Native audio is opt-in (launcher checkbox). Its notes live in
`platform/vita/` (HANDOFF, THIRD_PARTY for SDL2); the Vita build itself is
untested here (needs VitaSDK).

**Setup for players.** `docs/getting-started.md` walks from nothing to
playing on each OS, with troubleshooting for what went wrong in practice:
`./setup` for `./setup.sh`, the ROM set under another name (setup silently
built tools only), a different Daytona set (`daytona`, program ROMs
`epr-16722a`/`16723a`: `m2import: missing epr-16530a.12`), Start disabled.
`scripts/setup.py` now says so itself: with no `roms/daytona93.*` it names
any archives in `roms/`; a rejected set gets an explanation instead of a
traceback; on success it prints the command that starts the game. README's
Setup links to the guide.

**macOS (Apple clang, arm64, Metal) builds and plays.** First run on a Mac
with a real `daytona93` set turned up:

- `scripts/recompile.py` built only the check tools after generating code,
  never `daytona` or `m2run`, so a fresh `./setup.sh` left no game. It now
  builds everything.
- The launcher saved the ROM path as typed (`roms/daytona93.7z`), so the
  check failed and Start stayed disabled when run from another directory.
  It now stores the absolute path. A saved GPU choice the host lacks
  (Vulkan on a Mac without MoltenVK) exited at `SDL_CreateGPUDevice`; it now
  falls back to automatic.
- The seeds were short. The windowed game stopped at `0x1d8c`, then longer
  runs at `0x2266f8`, `0x5788`, `0x225028`, `0x223078`, `0x2265c4`: code the
  game reaches only through pointers in states the harvest never visited.
  `scripts/seed_scan.py` finds them statically (see Findings) and added 248
  seeds (334 -> 582): 24,504 -> 34,497 reachable instructions, recompile
  still all native.
- Time attack stopped in the geometrizer: texture-point/header reads and a
  polygon-RAM walk run one past the end of their memory. `GeoPtr`/`GeoPtr16`
  now wrap (see Findings).

Measured after, `m2run`: attract 40,000 frames (11.6 min of game time),
all 11 scripted scenarios in `scripts/inputs/` (races, courses, time attack,
test menus) run to the end, all native; race_basic screen hash unchanged
(`ad67233983ea8808`) by the wrap. `daytona` on Metal: 60 s, 3,396 frames,
no stop. **Not verified against MAME**: the newly seeded code has not been
lockstepped (it only runs in states the scenarios reach, and the harvest
did not), and the wrap has no MAME counterpart to compare with.

**Sound.** The Model 1 sound board runs natively: its 68000 program
(`epr-16489`/`16490`) is statically recompiled (`src/m68k` decoder,
`tools/m2sndrecomp`, runtime context `src/runtime/snd_cpu.h`), with the
YM3438 (ymfm, BSD-3) and both MultiPCMs (MAME's, transplanted into
`src/runtime/multipcm.cpp`) as native code on `snd::SoundBoard`
(`src/runtime/sound_board.cpp`). All 1,916 reachable instructions decode
exactly as MAME's 68000 disassembler prints them; the driver has no
indirect jumps. Lockstep against MAME's 68000 (`tools/m2sndcheck`, MAME
patch 0003, `M2TRACE_SNDLOG`): attract 15.7M instructions and race 77.9M
instructions, 3,648 interrupts, 5.16M device accesses, all identical.
No clock: the driver polls YM timer B (868 Hz tick) in its main loop and
takes the UART's RxRDY on IPL 2, so time is counted in 68000 instructions
(752,000 per second, MAME's rate on this program) and events land on it:
command bytes one line-time apart (31.25 kbit/s), YM timer expiries in
exact YM clocks. `GameLoop` advances the board one frame per video frame
and hands it that frame's UART bytes. `daytona` plays it through two SDL
audio streams (YM at 55.6 kHz, MultiPCMs at 44.6 kHz) with a small speed
trim holding 60 ms of queue; volume and mute in the launcher. `m2run --wav
FILE` writes it headless. Against MAME's own audio (`-wavwrite`) for 26 s
of attract: the same 48 command bytes, per-second loudness within a few
percent, a constant ~125 ms offset (when the i960 sends the first
commands), no tempo drift. Race: 3,636 bytes natively vs MAME's 3,648.
Checked here with SDL's disk audio driver (no sound card in the
container): continuous output from the windowed game.

**Launcher.** `daytona` opens a Dear ImGui launcher in its window
(`src/app/launcher.cpp`): ROM browse (SDL3's native file dialog: Windows,
macOS; xdg-desktop-portal or zenity on Linux; typed path as fallback) with
per-file verification, graphics API and fullscreen; a Controls tab binding
every arcade control to a key and a gamepad button or axis half (press to
bind), analogue triggers for the pedals and a stick for steering, live
meters, dead zone, invert. Settings save to `launcher.ini` in the SDL pref
path as they change. The ROM set is loaded natively from the zip
(`src/runtime/zip.cpp`, own inflate; `rom_import.cpp`, the importer's table):
images byte-identical to `scripts/m2import.py`'s, in 0.8 s. 7z ROM sets too (`src/runtime/archive.cpp`: the
7-Zip LZMA SDK's public-domain decoder; solid LZMA2, LZMA, PPMd checked
byte-identical to the zip import, 0.9 s for 7-Zip's default). The build's
importer is now the same C++ code (`tools/m2import`, used by
`scripts/recompile.py`), so a .7z-only user can build. Esc in game
returns to the launcher (Resume, Reset, Quit). Verified here under Xvfb on
Vulkan: verification, the Controls tab, a key rebind saved to the ini, Start
from the zip, pause, and the zenity file dialog. Resolution and upscaling
options are to come.

**The game is playable in a window.** `daytona` (`src/app/main.cpp`): SDL
3.4.16 (built from source, static) with SDL_GPU: Vulkan or Direct3D 12 on
Windows, Vulkan on Linux, Metal on macOS (`--gpu` to choose). Each composed
frame is uploaded to a GPU texture and blitted, letterboxed 4:3, onto the
swapchain; the game advances at the board's 57.52 frames/s and is presented
at the display's rate. Keyboard and gamepad map to the I/O board; settings
EEPROM and backup RAM persist in the SDL pref path. Verified here on Vulkan
(Mesa lavapipe under Xvfb): the attract demo in the window. Direct3D 12 and
Metal not run yet (no Windows or Mac here). The 3D layer is still drawn by
the CPU reference rasterizer; the GPU rasterizer is a later step.
`rt::GameLoop` (`src/runtime/game_loop.cpp`) holds the frame pacing that
`m2run` and `daytona` share.

**The game runs on its own.** `m2run` runs the recompiled game on the
native board runtime (`src/runtime/m2_board.cpp`) with no trace and no
MAME: boot, the settings screen, then the attract demo in full 3D.
Headless for now (frames dumped every N; `scripts/rgb2png.py`); 600 frames
in 5.7 s including the CPU rasterizer (106 frames/s), 23 M i960 and 12 M TGP
instructions, all native.

How it runs, with no clock:
- Frame pacing is the game's: vblank starts when the game waits in its
  wait-for-vblank loops (0x12b0-0x12bb, 0x12f0-0x12ff: spinning on the
  frame counter at 0x00500000); a CPU-bound frame (the boot texture upload
  at 0x1388) gets vblank after one frame's worth of work (110k
  instructions, as MAME measures 25 MHz / 57.52 Hz). Vblank ends when the
  handler has returned to the wait loop. A windowed build waits for vsync
  there; frame rate is the only limit.
- The TGP runs before the i960 reads buffer RAM: the game sends the TGP a
  command, writes -1 to the mailbox at 0x0091fff0 and spins until the TGP
  writes 0 (0x1166c). Without this the game waits forever.
- I/O board: the dual-port RAM mailbox protocol, native (command 1: latch
  inputs into bytes 0-10; 3: load the 128-byte settings EEPROM into
  0x100-0x17f; 2: store it). Inputs take the scripts/inputs format
  (`m2run ... --inputs FILE`).
- Sound UART: TxRDY is immediate, so the IRQ3 handler drains its queue at
  once; the sound board receives the bytes at the line rate (Sound, above).

With scripted inputs (`--inputs scripts/inputs/race_basic.txt`) the whole
game flow runs standalone: coin-up, Circuit Select, car select, the race's
rolling start (3,000 frames in 23 s headless: 80 M i960 and 62 M TGP
instructions, 381 bytes sent to the sound board).

**The whole screen now renders natively, identical to MAME.** `src/runtime/video.cpp`
adds the segaic24 tilemap chip (four 64x64-tile layers, per-line scroll,
special window modes, 8-pixel window masks), the tilemap palette pens (as
MAME computes them at palette write time, refreshed each frame once a scroll
colour is written), the CRTC offsets, and MAME's composition order (2D back,
3D, 2D front). It runs at the i960 instruction count of each MAME screen
update (vblank end; patch 0002 `su`/`scr` lines) and is held to a hash of
MAME's composed screen: **596 of 596 attract frames and 5,996 of 5,996 race
frames identical**, 3D layer 5,587 of 5,587. Dumped frames (boot settings
screen, attract with HUD) are byte-identical to MAME's.

Everything on screen now comes from native code: the recompiled i960 and
TGP programs, and native C++ for the fixed-function chips (geometrizer,
rasterizer, tilemaps). Still replayed from MAME's trace in the harness: the
sound board (UART bytes) and the I/O board (dual-port RAM). Design change:
the sound 68000 will be statically recompiled, not interpreted.

**M3 started: the 3D layer renders natively, pixel-identical to MAME.**
`src/runtime/raster.cpp` is a CPU reference rasterizer (MAME's Model 2
renderer and the poly.h triangle/polygon setup, transplanted). In
`m2native`, at each vblank it draws the previous display list from our own
video memories (palette, colour translation, luma, texture RAM, all written
by the recompiled i960) and is held to a hash of MAME's 3D layer (patch 0002
`fb` lines): **423 of 423 rendered attract frames and 5,587 of 5,587 race
frames identical**, and a dumped frame is byte-identical to MAME's. A
mutant (one gamma entry off by one) fails every frame. Frame dumps:
`M2NATIVE_FBDUMP_DIR`/`M2NATIVE_FBDUMP_EVERY` (ours),
`M2TRACE_FBDUMP_DIR`/`M2TRACE_FBDUMP_EVERY` (MAME); `scripts/rgb2png.py`
converts either (game output: keep under traces/). Finding on the way: the
original Model 2's texture RAM keeps only 16 bits of each 32-bit write,
packing two writes per stored dword (MAME tex0_w/tex1_w); the bus now does
the same. CRTC offsets are still taken from MAME's log (they come from the
segaic24 tilemap chip, next).

**M2 geometry, native and matching MAME.** The whole geometry path now runs
natively inside `m2native`: recompiled i960, recompiled TGP, buffer RAM, and
the geometrizer (`src/runtime/geo.cpp`, MAME's HLE transplanted; the
original Model 2 geometrizer's DSP code is undumped). At each MAME vblank
(same i960 instruction count) the geometrizer walks our buffer RAM and is
held to MAME's log (patch 0002, `M2TRACE_GEOLOG`): every word it hands the
rasterizer and every polygon kept after culling and clipping, vertices bit
for bit.

| scenario | frames | rasterizer words | polygons kept | result |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| attract | 597 | 11,954,823 | 403,475 | identical |
| race_steer_left | 5,997 | 151,874,210 | 6,658,999 | identical |
| time_attack | 5,997 | 136,744,927 | 5,937,107 | identical |

A mutant (luma off by one when it is exactly 100, in all four parsers)
diverges at frame 173, rasterizer word 385. A one-ulp change to a vertex
cannot show: the geometrizer hands the rasterizer 24-bit floats (MAME's
`f2u(x) >> 8`), which drop the low 8 bits. `scripts/m2_check.sh SCENARIO`
runs all of it (the race's geometrizer log is 2.8 GB of text; it is deleted
after the check unless M2_CHECK_KEEP is set).

**M2 started: the TGP program is statically recompiled and matches MAME.**
The TGP runs a 2,024-word program the i960 uploads from the data ROM;
`m2tgprecomp` turns it into native C++ (MAME's MB86233 semantics inlined per
instruction from `src/runtime/tgp.h`; no interpreter, no hand-written HLE),
and `m2tgpcheck` replays MAME's TGP-side log (patch 0002) through it:

| scenario | TGP instructions | input words | output words | banked accesses |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| attract, 600 frames | 12,390,181 | 1,293,703 | 398,072 | 7,789 |
| race_steer_left | 230,600,970 | 21,489,825 | 6,727,552 | 3,233,496 |
| time_attack | 97,745,484 | 8,089,105 | 3,291,602 | 2,025,772 |
| test_tgp | 32,597,984 | 3,300,128 | 1,083,012 | 7,789 |

All identical to MAME; in attract every register was also checked after
every instruction (`M2TRACE_TGPPC`). A mutant (fml result off by one ulp when
A = 1.0) diverges at TGP instruction 2,339. Native speed ~500 M TGP
instructions/s (race: 0.48 s for 231 M).

**Native i960 + native TGP together** (`m2native` now models the geometry
ports, TGP FIFOs and buffer RAM instead of replaying them; the TGP runs on
demand, clockless, until its input FIFO is empty):

| scenario | i960 instructions | TGP instructions | TGP output words | buffer RAM hash |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| attract | 70,926,456 | 12,390,181 | 398,072 identical | identical at 1,153 of 1,153 samples |
| race_steer_left | 643,000,979 | 230,600,970 | 6,727,552 identical | identical at 11,951 of 11,951 |
| time_attack | 663,975,129 | 97,745,385 | 3,291,602 identical | identical at 11,951 of 11,951 |

Buffer RAM (128 KB) is built natively from its three writers: the i960, the
geometrizer command port (0x800000) and the TGP's banked writes. The only
reads that differ from MAME (103 in attract, 64,956 of 5,451,850 in the race)
are all the i960 polling the TGP's mailbox, the last three dwords of buffer
RAM (0x91fff0-0x91fff8, TGP bank offsets 0x7ffc-0x7ffe): our TGP has already
finished when the i960 looks; MAME's, paced by cycle estimates, has not. A
timing artefact like the UART one, so lockstep uses MAME's value there and
counts it. Finding on the way: races read and write the TGP FIFOs 16 bits at
a time (MAME's 32-bit handlers see the whole dword, other lanes zero).

**M1 met with native code**: `m2recomp` statically recompiles 23,262
instructions (seeds: boot record + `seeds/daytona93.txt`) to portable C++,
and `m2native` runs them with no interpreter and no fallback. It matches
MAME for all 600 attract frames: 70,926,456 instructions, every one native,
1,153 samples, 3,315,201 device events, 627 interrupts; 1.3 s (55 M
instructions/s with lockstep checks on every instruction).
`scripts/recompile.sh` generates and builds it (into git-ignored
build/gen); `scripts/m2_check.sh` traces MAME and runs both harnesses.
An address with no recompiled code is a hard error naming it.

Beyond attract, the same native code matches MAME through seven scripted
scenarios (coin up, selects, races, test mode), every instruction, device
access and interrupt, including the sound-UART interrupts that land mid-code
during races:

| scenario | frames | instructions | device events | interrupts |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| race_steer_left | 6,000 | 643,000,979 | 39,750,589 | 11,443 |
| course_advanced | 6,000 | 640,678,236 | 42,356,938 | 12,475 |
| course_expert | 6,000 | 641,018,396 | 42,010,671 | 12,419 |
| time_attack | 6,000 | 663,975,129 | 20,342,792 | 11,506 |
| test_mode | 4,000 | 439,587,066 | 6,954,614 | 4,051 |
| test_tgp | 3,500 | 385,086,539 | 6,708,822 | 3,578 |
| test_memory | 3,500 | 385,423,629 | 6,748,842 | 3,553 |

`scripts/m2_check.sh SCENARIO` reruns one (inputs from
`scripts/inputs/SCENARIO.txt`); each takes ~7 min of MAME plus ~15 s native.

The reference interpreter (`src/refcore`, MAME's executor) is a test
oracle only: `m2replay` uses it; the game build will never link it.

Earlier, **M1 reference milestone**: `m2replay` runs Daytona's own code through
the runtime (MAME's i960 semantics, transplanted) with devices replayed from a
MAME trace, and matches MAME for all 600 attract frames: 70,926,456
instructions, 1,153 samples (RAM hashes + registers), 3,315,201 device
events, 627 interrupts; 2.0 s.

M0 tooling runs against real MAME with the real game (`daytona93`, user's ROM
set, git-ignored `roms/` in this cloud container, never committed). Model-2-only
MAME with the harvest patch builds here (`scripts/build_mame.sh`, ~50 min cold,
15 s incremental); `scripts/run_trace.sh` runs it headless.
Built and tested here: i960 decoder + `i960dis`, trace library + `tracediff`,
and the MAME plugin `tools/mame-plugins/m2trace` (trace recorder, input
recorder/replayer). The plugin is tested only against a mock of MAME's Lua API.

Build: `./setup.sh` (Linux, macOS) or `setup.ps1` (Windows) installs the
toolchain, fetches the pinned dependencies, builds, recompiles the game if
`roms/daytona93.zip` is there, and runs the tests (see README.md). Verified
end to end on Linux with GCC and Clang; macOS and Windows (MSVC) not yet run.
The Lua tests need `pip install lupa` (Lua 5.4) and skip without it.

Running the plugin (user's machine, with their ROM set):

    M2TRACE_OUT=traces/attract.m2tr M2TRACE_FRAMES=600 \
    mame daytona -plugin m2trace -pluginspath "<mame>/plugins;<repo>/tools/mame-plugins"

`M2TRACE_RECORD_INPUT` / `M2TRACE_REPLAY_INPUT` record and replay inputs;
`docs/trace-format.md` has the rest.

## Complete

- Design document.
- Project rules (`rules.md`) and `.gitignore`.
- M0 step 1: "from memory" figures checked against MAME `sega/model2.cpp` at
  `dddd73680656e355bb2b5beecab1167c9f07bf81` and the Model 2 MiSTer core at
  `591e148e87d27e03d50cbf7318bf0b1d1328c4bf`. Design doc corrected in place
  (Target hardware summary, TGP HLE, Floating point, Audio, Open questions).
- M0 i960 disassembler: `src/i960` (decoder + MAME-syntax formatter),
  `tools/i960dis` (linear sweep; `--interleave` joins the ROM_LOAD32_WORD pair),
  `tests/test_decode` (66 hand-encoded checks), `tests/mame_oracle`
  (differential against MAME's own `i960dis.cpp`, compiled unmodified).
- Ghidra SLEIGH cross-check (`tests/ghidra_oracle.py`, third-party module
  mumbel/ghidra_i960 via pypcode, `scripts/fetch_ghidra_i960.sh`).
- `src/i960/reach` (recursive descent + boot-record seeds), `i960dis --follow`,
  `tests/test_reach` (19 checks).
- M0 trace format, `tracediff`, MAME plugin and input recorder
  (`docs/trace-format.md`, `src/trace`, `tools/tracediff`,
  `tools/mame-plugins/m2trace`), with `tests/test_trace` (30 checks),
  `tests/lua_core_test.py` (19) and `tests/lua_plugin_mock_test.py` (17).

## Next, in order

1. Scenarios that reach the other 167 seed_scan seeds (other endings, name
   entry, link play), checked with scripts/m2_check.sh like attract_long and
   race_to_end.
2. Hardware renderer: exact pixels against the CPU reference (stage 4).

## Open decisions

- Project licence. The Model 2 MiSTer core is GPL-3; lifting from it decides
  this.
- FP oracle for lockstep: MAME disagrees with the hardware model on cvtri
  ties (see Findings). When a replay diverges there, the trace diff will show
  MAME's value; the recompiled build follows the model (rules: PCB > MAME).
  Settling which the PCB does needs a hardware measurement.
- `addc` carry. MAME never sets it. Recompile to the silicon and flag the diff
  when it fires (the MiSTer core made the same call, its study §2.3).

## Findings

Confirmed from MAME `model2.cpp` (all MAME figures, not PCB measurements):

| Item | Was (from memory) | MAME |
| --- | --- | --- |
| i960KB clock | ~25 MHz | 25 MHz (`50_MHz_XTAL / 2`) |
| TGP | MB86234 + microcode ROM | one MB86234 at 50 MHz; program uploaded by the i960, 2,024 words from the data ROM; run LLE |
| Resolution | ~496x384 | 496x384 active, 656x424 total, 16 MHz pixel clock |
| Refresh | ~57.5 Hz | 57.524 Hz; line rate 24.39 kHz (MAME: "TODO: from System 24") |
| Sound | 68000 + 2x SCSP, ~11 MHz | **Model 1 sound board**: 68000 @ 10 MHz + YM3438 + 2x MultiPCM |
| Main to sound | command latch | i8251 UART at 31.25 kbit/s; IRQ3 handler is the transmit loop |
| I/O | direct ADCs | Model 1 I/O board, own Z80 @ 4 MHz, via MB8421 dual-port RAM |
| IRQ order | unknown | bit 0 vblank -> IRQ0, bits 2-5 timers -> IRQ2, bit 10 UART -> IRQ3; ICR 0f0e0d0c (measured): all priority 1 |

i960 decoder (MAME `i960.cpp` / `i960dis.cpp` at `dddd7368`):

- MAME's executor implements 62 non-REG and 102 REG opcodes; its disassembler
  knows many more (whole-family table). The recompiler accepts only the
  executor's set.
- Executor and disassembler disagree on three encodings; decoder follows the
  executor and flags them: CTRL/COBR bits 1:0 (executor adds them to the
  target), MEMB bits 6:5 (executor ignores), MEMB scale > 4 (executor shifts).
- MAME's disassembler table has `ldtime` at 0x671, shadowed by `ediv`; it can
  never print. `movre` appears at 0x6e1 (undocumented, executed) and 0x6e9.
- Differential test, random + every opcode byte x 65,536 tails: 71,108,864
  words, 0 mismatches, 8.0 s on 4 threads (this container). Mutation check:
  three deliberate faults (MEMB scale bound, COBR displacement mask, one REG
  mnemonic) gave 79,619 / 2,220,826 / 9,837 mismatches, so the test can fail.
- Exhaustive run, `mame_oracle --exhaustive`: all 4,294,967,296 first words
  (second word random per word), 0 mismatches, 596 s on 4 threads (this
  container). Text and reported length both compared.

Trace tooling:

- Every signal the design doc asks for except indirect branch targets is
  reachable from MAME's Lua API alone (write/read taps, `read_range`,
  `state[]`), so the plugin needs no MAME patch yet.
- MAME's end-of-frame notifier is not on a guest instruction boundary, so it
  cannot be a lockstep sample point; the default is the vblank-ack store.
  Unverified for Daytona until the first trace.
- Mock-driven plugin test: record -> replay reproduces the trace exactly; a
  replay value applied one frame late is caught at the right frame; a memory
  change is reported as a region hash at the right epoch.
- The Lua encoder and the C++ writer produce byte-identical traces for the
  same content; the Lua hash equals an independent Python FNV over 8 sizes
  either side of the 1 KiB unpack block.
- Hashing reads 1.4 MiB per sample in Lua; cost unmeasured until a real run.
  If it is too slow, hash fewer regions per sample, not a weaker hash.

First real MAME runs (`daytona93`, MAME `dddd7368` + harvest patch, 600
frames of attract, headless, empty NVRAM each run):

- Plugin loads and every tap fires: 3,567,333 events in 600 frames. 68 s per
  run with tracing on this container (MAME reports 14.9% speed).
- Found and fixed: `screen.frame_number` is a method at this MAME, not the
  property the Lua reference documents; and MAME silently drops errors raised
  in tap callbacks, so the first run had 0 samples and no message. Samples are
  now pcall-wrapped and failures reported.
- **MAME is deterministic for Daytona**: two independent runs gave
  byte-identical traces (60,942,182 bytes, 1,154 epochs, 3,567,333 events)
  and identical branch harvests.
- vblank-ack sampling works, but the handler writes the ack (`fffffffe`) twice
  back to back: steady state is exactly 2 samples per frame, the second epoch
  holding only the second ack. Deterministic, so lockstep is fine; every other
  sample is redundant (cost, not correctness).
- ICR = `0f0e0d0c`, set once (synmov at 0x00000a40): IRQ0-3 -> vectors
  0x0c-0x0f, **all priority 1**. Taken in attract: vector 0x0c (vblank) 576x,
  handler 0x0e00; vector 0x0f (sound UART) 51x, handler 0x0f50. Timers
  (IRQ2) never fire; final enable mask = vblank only.
- Geometrizer program port (0x00804000) **is** written: 411,757 writes, from
  epoch 89. TGP FIFO: 773,279 writes, 697,078 reads.
- Harvest: 16 `bx` sites / 49 targets, 2 `callx` sites / 56 targets; no
  `balx`, no `calls`.
- Static reach with the 107 harvested targets as seeds: 89 -> 13,081
  instructions, 0 stops on non-executable opcodes, **0 quirk encodings in
  reachable code**, 31 indirect sites (18 exercised by attract).

Scripted gameplay in real MAME (`scripts/inputs/race_basic.txt`: 3 coins,
start, confirm selects, hold accelerator; 6,000 frames, no steering):

- Replay self-check passes in real MAME: "replay matched the recording for
  5997 frames", in two independent runs; the two branch harvests are identical.
- First attempt stayed in attract: default settings take 3 coins per credit
  (screen showed CREDIT 1/3). With 3 coins, snapshots show car select, then
  the Beginner course, lap 2 of 8 by frame 6,000.
- Full run 103 s emulated at ~14.5% speed, with or without tracing (MAME's
  software 3D dominates; the Lua taps cost ~nothing).
- Race harvest: 20 bx sites / 53 targets, 6 callx sites / 113 targets.
  Interrupts over 6,000 frames: vblank 5,975, sound UART 4,820, timers never.
- Attract + race seeds (168): static reach 21,850 instructions (attract alone
  13,081), 26 of 35 static indirect sites exercised, still 0 non-executable
  opcodes and 0 quirk encodings reached.

Harvest over 15 scripted runs (attract, races, manual gearbox, time attack,
test mode; all replays self-checked "matched"):

| runs | merged seeds | static reach | indirect sites hit / found |
| attract | 107 | 13,081 | 18 / 31 |
| + race | 168 | 21,850 | 26 / 35 |
| + manual, time attack, test mode | 319 | 23,138 | 46 / 67 |
| + round 3 | 333 | 23,258 | 47 / 68 |

- Still 0 non-executable opcodes and 0 quirk encodings in reachable code.
- FP in reachable code: 108 instructions, only `cvtri` 39, `cmpr` 37, `cvtir`
  22, `scaler` 8, `cvtzri` 2. No FP arithmetic, transcendentals or extended
  forms: the FP oracle question shrinks to five operations.
- Reached and confirmed by snapshot: Beginner race (auto and manual with
  shifting), time attack (start + accelerator at car select), test mode menu
  and sound test.
- Not reached: Advanced/Expert courses (circuit select stays on Beginner with
  steering pulses held 30 frames at 0xe0 from frame 1560 and from 1450), TGP
  and memory test items (7 red presses from frame 1500 land on SOUND TEST
  twice, deterministically). Cause unknown; not guessed further.
- Circuit and car select confirm on an accelerator press ("step to choose");
  holding the accelerator from the start picks the defaults.

FP, step 1 (`src/i960/fp`, `tests/test_fp`, `tests/fp_vs_mame`):

- Operand forms measured: all 108 reachable FP instructions use g/l registers
  (single precision in and out); none uses fp0-fp3 or FP literals. AC =
  `3f001000` in all 1,153 attract samples: round to nearest, exceptions masked.
- Reference = SoftFloat 3e extF80; native fast paths = host float, round to
  nearest. Exhaustive proof: cvtri, cvtzri, cvtir over every 2^32 input, scaler
  over every 2^32 single at n = 0, 1, -1, 127, 128, -126, -127, -149, -150, 254,
  -300; 0 mismatches, ~5 min on 4 cores. Plus 36 hand-computed IEEE values,
  specials cross-product, 2^26 random each. A MAME-style fast cvtri
  (`std::round`) fails with 130,905 mismatches (quick run), so the proof bites.
- Bug found on the way: SoftFloat's `extFloat80_t` field order depends on
  `LITTLEENDIAN`, defined only in its private platform.h; C++ callers saw the
  other order and every result was wrong. Now a public definition.
- MAME vs model, every input (`fp_vs_mame`, ~15 min on 4 cores):
  | op | inputs | disagree (MAME on x86-64) | cause |
  | cvtri | 4,294,967,296 | 8,388,608 | every exact .5 tie: MAME `round()` away from zero, IEEE to even |
  | cvtzri | 4,294,967,296 | 0 | |
  | cvtir | 4,294,967,296 | 0 | |
  | cmpr | 268,435,456 pairs | 0 | |
  | scaler | 77,309,411,328 (18 exponents) | 14 | 0 x 2^n (n >= 1024), inf x 2^n (n <= -1075): MAME pow() gives NaN |
  MAME built for ARM64 also differs on 830,472,191 cvtzri and 830,472,191 +
  8,388,608 cvtri inputs (NaN, out of range): its C casts are UB and
  saturate, so MAME's own result is host-dependent there.
- Practical risk for lockstep: a Daytona cvtri on an exact .5 value. The
  trace diff will show it as a register/RAM divergence right after a cvtri.
- MAME never sets FP exception flags in AC; the model reports them. Where the
  i960 records them and whether Daytona reads them is unconfirmed.

M1 groundwork:

- UART-interrupt lockstep: option (a) chosen (safe points in the shipped
  build; a test harness replays MAME's delivery points).
- Delivery points are keyed by MAME's completed-instruction count (patch):
  a stalled FIFO op counts once. Attract, 600 frames: 70,926,456
  instructions, 1,882 interrupt events (1,254 line changes, 622 immediate
  takes, 5 pending-table takes). Two runs: identical IRQ logs and traces.
- Stalled accesses: MAME's `i960_stall()` rewinds IP to PIP, so the plugin
  marks an access with ip == pip as stalled (new record types 0x12/0x13);
  comparisons drop them by default.
- Read taps now cover every non-RAM range the i960 reads (irq, timers, geo,
  copro status to 0x3f, comm, renderer), so the harness can answer them all.
- `scripts/m2import.py` builds program.bin and main_data.bin from the user's
  zip (CRC-checked, MAME's layout) into git-ignored build/rom_cache.

M1 reference core (`src/runtime`, `tools/m2replay`, test only):

- Semantics: MAME's `i960.cpp` transplanted (BSD-3, notice kept); runs at
  36 M instructions/s interpreted.
- Bugs found on the way to MATCH, in order: (1) the bus treated
  read-only-tapped ranges as write-checked; (2) **MAME's ldl/ldt/ldq and
  stores advance the address only on regions flagged BURST** (RAM/ROM, geo
  program port, TGP function port, comm); elsewhere they repeat the address
  (FIFO pops). The bus now carries MAME's BURST flags per region; (3) **the
  plugin's region hash was wrong**: `read_range(first, last, 32)` steps one
  *byte* at a time, so it hashed a dword at every byte address. Fixed with
  step 4; MAME-vs-MAME comparisons had still passed because it was
  deterministic; (4) buffer RAM is written by the geometrizer data port and
  by the TGP (`copro_tgp_memory_w`), not only the i960, so in M1 it is
  treated as a device: the i960's accesses are recorded and replayed, and
  its hash is left to M2; (5) the plugin's own `read_range` fired the
  buffer-RAM read taps while hashing; taps are now suppressed while sampling.
- A per-instruction log on both sides (`M2TRACE_PCLOG`, `M2REPLAY_PCLOG`:
  count, PIP, AC, register-file hash) located bug (2) at instruction 109.
- Mutation check: addo off by one when src1 == 1 (fired 129 times) diverges
  at epoch 3; one program-ROM byte flipped (copied to RAM at boot) diverges at
  epoch 0. Three earlier mutants never fired and so proved nothing either way
  (operand 12345, base 0x00500000, a data-ROM byte attract never reads).

Real program image (`daytona93`, epr-16530a/16531a, counts only):

- Linear sweep of the 256 KiB image: 55,098 lines, 16,280 undecodable words,
  7,356 flagged quirks, 759 non-executable opcodes. Mostly data decoded as
  code; not meaningful as code statistics.
- Recursive descent from the boot record (`i960dis --follow`, with the
  0x00220000 mirror): reset IP 0x860, 0 interrupt handlers (the PRCB's table
  is in RAM), 4 system procedures; 89 reachable instructions, 1 indirect site,
  0 quirks. The reset path ends in `b .` idle loops. Static analysis cannot
  get past boot without harvested targets.
- Mainline Ghidra has never shipped an i960 module (checked HEAD `8e9a8e7a`,
  the last 40 release tags, and full history). The user pointed to the
  third-party mumbel/ghidra_i960 (Apache-2.0), now used.

Ghidra SLEIGH cross-check (mumbel/ghidra_i960 `727ef787` via pypcode 3.3.3):

- All 23,258 reachable Daytona instructions: 0 differences (validity,
  mnemonic, length, target, operands).
- 1,000,000 random words, 1.5 s per 100k: after normalising syntax (MAME omits
  a x1 index scale, prints negative displacements unsigned, prints mode-5 as an
  absolute address; Ghidra prints `disp (ip)`), 72 differences in 5 groups,
  all known: MAME's disassembler names the integer src1 of cvtir/cvtilr/
  scaler/scalerl as an FP register (executor `get_1_ri` and SLEIGH read an
  integer); and SLEIGH decodes `movre` only at 0x6e1, MAME also at 0x6e9.
- The cross-check found four more encoding classes MAME treats specially;
  now decoder quirks: `sfr` (s1/s2, COBR bit 0: Cx special-function
  registers, ignored by MAME), `literaldst` (literal destination: MAME
  fatalerror, so no longer executable), `fpliteral` (FP literal other than
  fp0-3/+0.0/+1.0: MAME reads 0.0), `testfields` (test* with non-zero unused
  fields). 0 of any quirk in reachable code.
- Mutation check: making MEMB mode 7 read a displacement gives 2,871
  differences, exit 1.

Also found:

- A separate geometrizer (0x00800000 / 0x00804000) walks the display list in
  buffer RAM at vblank. It is not the TGP. MAME's is HLE in host `float`.
- The SCSP figures in the MiSTer core's design study are for 2A-CRX in general;
  its README confirms Daytona's working sound is 68000 + FM + MultiPCM. Both
  sources agree with MAME.
- MAME `subc` carry was fixed upstream since MAME 0.289; `addc` was not
  (operands still `uint32_t` before widening, `i960.cpp` ~line 1359).
- The design doc's "15 kHz capture" was wrong for this timing; changed to
  24 kHz medium resolution, pending PCB confirmation.
- macOS (Apple clang, arm64) failed to link `test_fp`/`fp_vs_mame`: C++ sees
  SoftFloat's globals as `extern thread_local` and calls a TLS wrapper
  function that the C (`_Thread_local`) definitions never emit. Linux accepts
  it, which is why it went unnoticed. C++ now gets `__thread` (GCC/Clang) and
  MSVC keeps `thread_local`. Checked: macOS `./setup.sh` builds with 5/5 tests
  passing; Ubuntu 24.04 arm64 GCC 13 and Clang 18 build `test_fp` with 0
  mismatches. Windows is untested, but MSVC's definition did not change.
- The harvest's seeds covered only the states the scripted MAME runs
  visited. The game reaches code four other ways, all now scanned by
  `scripts/seed_scan.py` to a fixed point (recompiling each round):
  - game-mode table at `0x18cc`, 31 entries, `ld 0x18cc[g0*4]; callx`
    at `0x18bc`, index the mode byte at `0x5010a0` (harvest reached 9);
  - task state chains: each state stores the next state's address with
    `lda` (`0x1dd4`: `lda 0x2266f8,r5; st r5,0xc(r3)`; `0x2266f8` itself
    stores `0x226764` at `0xc(g13)`);
  - jump tables read as `ld T[r*4]` then `bx` (`0x5808`, masked to 4) or
    `lda T[r*4]` then `ld`, `callx` (`0x225010`);
  - handler addresses in ROM data: 24-byte object records in the program
    ROM (`0x2375bc`: `0x223078` then floats) and tables in the main data
    ROM (`0x28660cc` -> `0x2265c4`, a bare `ret`).
  A candidate counts only if `i960dis` decodes it to a `ret` or branch with
  no `?`, `!noexec` or `!quirk` first. That rejected float constants that
  `lda` loads (`0x50d0` = 1.0f, `0xcdd8`). From the committed seeds the scan
  finds 275 entry points in one round and nothing in the next; 248 of them
  are the added seeds, the other 27 fall inside code those reach.
- Geometrizer reads past the end of memory (time attack, frame < 6,000):
  texture point/header data (`GeoPtr16`, 4-8 words from a masked start) and
  a polygon RAM walk (`GeoPtr`, index 32,768 of 32,768). MAME's raw
  pointers read whatever follows the array there. The display list is not
  ours at fault: time attack matched MAME to the word, buffer RAM included.
  Now wrapped to the memory size, as a hardware address counter would;
  unconfirmed on the PCB.

## What not to re-propose

- SCSP for Daytona. It is the Model 1 sound board (MAME `model2o` config and
  the MiSTer core's working sound on hardware).
- Five TGPs. One device; "5x" was a board-level package count.
- MAME's frame notifier as the lockstep sample point (see Trace tooling).
- `read_range(a, b, 32)` without a step of 4 (reads every byte address).
- A mutation test whose mutant is not shown to fire.
- Using MAME's disassembler as the decode authority. It is the text oracle
  only; semantics come from the executor.
- `THREAD_LOCAL=thread_local` for C++ users of SoftFloat (breaks the macOS
  link; see Findings).
- Seeding one "no recompiled code at X" at a time. Each state stores the
  next, so the game stops again one state on; run `scripts/seed_scan.py`.
- A function-start test (previous word is `ret` or `b`) on its own for code
  pointers: it rejected `0x2266f8`, whose previous word is the second word
  of an 8-byte instruction. `seed_scan.py` uses it only for the data ROM.
- Every aligned word of the 32 MB data ROM as a candidate without that test:
  5,497 candidates, mostly chance matches in graphics data.
- A TGP microcode ROM dump. The program is uploaded at boot from the game's
  data ROM; dump TGP program RAM only after the upload, or it is zeros.

M1 native (`tools/m2recomp`, `tools/m2native`, `src/runtime/lockstep`):

- One label per instruction; operands, branch targets and FP fast paths
  resolved at recompile time; `goto` for direct transfers, a dispatch switch
  for indirect ones. Unknown instructions or FP operand forms stop the
  recompile (exit 1), so nothing is left to run at runtime.
- Lockstep (`src/runtime/lockstep`) applies MAME's interrupt lines and takes
  at the same completed-instruction counts; shared by both harnesses.
- **IAC 0x93 (reinitialise) is an indirect transfer**: boot reinitialises to
  0x924 through `synmovq`. The first native run stopped there (no code); the
  harvest patch now logs IAC targets and the seeds include it.
- Mutation check: the generator's addo template off by one when src1 == 1
  diverges at epoch 3.
